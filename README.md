## Installation

1. First, make sure to have Neovim installed on your system. You can install it using your package manager. For example, on a system with the `pkg` package manager, you can run:

    ```
    pkg update && pkg upgrade
    pkg install neovim git openjdk-17 gradle clang python nodejs-lts ripgrep fd
    ```

2. Clone this repository into your Neovim configuration directory. Typically, this directory is located at `~/.config/nvim`. You can do this by running:

    ```
    git clone <repository_url> ~/.config/nvim
    ```

3. Once cloned, navigate into the `~/.config/nvim` directory.

4. Run the following command to update plugins:

    ```
    nvim -c "MasonUpdate" -c "PackerInstall"
    ```

    During the installation process, you may be prompted to install additional components. Navigate and press 'i' for each component listed.

    - cucumber-language-server
    - gradle-language-server
    - groovy-language-server
    - java-debug-adapter
    - java-test
    - jdtls

5. If any issues arise during the setup process, you can check the health of Neovim by running:

    ```
    nvim -c "checkhealth"
    nvim -c ":LspLog"
    ```
